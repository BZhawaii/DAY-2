      <h5>The Orinda House was D-A- Y’s first project and something we are extremely proud of. It is a remodel and addition project located in Orinda, California. From initial planning through construction, we worked very closely with the owners who also acted as the General Contractor on the project. Our challenge was to preserve the original house’s exterior charm despite the needed addition to make the house functional for a growing family. In the end, our clients got a spacious home that respects it’s past, but also feels warm and modern, complete with solar panels.</h5>
